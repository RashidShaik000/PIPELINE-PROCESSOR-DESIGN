DESCRIPTION OF PIPELINE PROCESSOR DESIGN: A pipeline processor design is a technique where instruction processing is divided into sequential stages, allowing multiple instructions to be worked on concurrently. This improves overall performance by overlapping execution steps, rather than processing one instruction at a time.

TOOLS USED: hardware components like Registers and Combinational logic circuits, as well as software tools for simulation, verification, and synthesis.

APPLICATIONS: Increases the throughput of the processor, meaning more instructions can be completed in a given time, leading to improved performance.
